![alt tag](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/FlameDevelopment/Flamedevelopment.co.uk/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)

This aims to be the new build of http://flamedevelopment.co.uk. I'm taking a step back and rebuilding the base system from scratch, learning Yii2 (coming from Yii1) and focusing on a 'modular' design.

Technologies used:
* Yii2 (http://www.yiiframework.com/)
* NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Composer (https://getcomposer.org/)
* Semantic-UI (http://semantic-ui.com/)
* Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Handlebars JS (http://handlebarsjs.com/)
* Html2Json (https://github.com/Jxck/html2json)

**Disclaimer: All code is work-in-progress, please automatically assume I've apologised if any of it offends you.**
